            Pros of Skipping Classes on Tuesday:
            <br>
            1. Free Time: Skipping classes on Tuesday allows you to have more free time to engage in other activities,
            pursue personal interests, or simply relax and recharge.
            <br>
            2. Avoidance of Uninteresting or Irrelevant Material: By skipping classes, you have the
            chance to avoid lectures or discussions that you may find uninteresting, repetitive, or not necessary for
            your academic goals.
            <br>
            3. Flexibility in Scheduling: Skipping classes on Tuesday can provide flexibility in
            your schedule, enabling you to allocate time to important commitments, such as part-time jobs, internships,
            or personal responsibilities.

            Cons of Skipping Classes on Tuesday:
            <br>
            1. Missed Learning Opportunities: Skipping classes means missing out on important information and learning opportunities that
            can contribute to your academic success and understanding of the subject.
            <br>
            2. Difficulty in Catching Up: Choosing to skip classes on Tuesday can lead to difficulty in catching up with missed lectures, assignments,
            or discussions, resulting in added stress and potentially lower grades.
            <br>
            3. Lack of Accountability:
            Repeatedly skipping classes on Tuesday can foster a lack of accountability and discipline, which may
            negatively impact your overall academic performance, motivation, and work ethic.
